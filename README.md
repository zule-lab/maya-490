# Land-use type and neighbourhoods influence the proportion of native trees in urban forests

## Research Questions

My research objective is to assess the extent to which differences in urban green space type influence the presence of native species and trees throughout the urban forest by considering three different neighborhoods in Montreal. This analysis will be further developed by considering native biomass, which may help to further assess the extent to which native trees are supporting other diversity in cities. Native species were determined based on two scales, a smaller local scale, and a larger regional scale. 
 
Specifically, I will be asking the following questions: 

1.	How does the proportion of native trees in Montreal's urban forest differ across four different land use types and three different neighbourhoods when considering two different native regions?
2.	Are these results consistent when considering abundance (proportion of native trees), species richness (proportion of native species), and biomass (proportion of native biomass)?
